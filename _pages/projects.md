# Projects
Here are some of the key projects I've worked on:

## UAV Testing & Standards
- Developed wildfire suppression UAV test methods for XPRIZE Wildfire.
- Designed confined-space UAV maneuverability trials in ISO containers.

## AI & Computer Vision
- Integrated YOLO-OCR for UAV thermal imaging analysis.
- Developed particle filter-based localization algorithms.

## Robotics & Simulation
- Created 3D CAD models of UAV test environments.
- Led AI-enhanced UAV perception research.
