In August 2020, I helped plan, fabricate, and execute standardized sUAS test evaluations for the National Unmanned Aircraft Systems Program. This initiative, led by NIST, DOJ, and DHS, developed standardized UAV performance assessments for public safety, emergency response, and law enforcement applications.

Key Mission Categories

- Reconnaissance and mapping for structural surveillance and GPS-denied navigation
- Emergency scene investigation using high-resolution imaging and thermal detection
- Operator proficiency and UAV performance assessments through standardized flight and data collection tests

Standardized Testing Methods

More than 20 evaluations were conducted based on NIST sUAS test methods, including:

- Battery endurance and maneuverability
- Obstacle avoidance and flight stability
- Aerial mapping and imaging accuracy
- Data security and communication range

I contributed to site layout design, test lane setup, and UAV trial execution, ensuring quantifiable, repeatable assessments.

Event Details

Location: County Police Training Facility in Maryland  
Dates: August, 2020  

This federally supported test site continues to serve as a UAV training and credentialing facility.

Impact and Next Steps

The results helped shape national UAV performance standards, guiding procurement for DOJ and DHS agencies.
