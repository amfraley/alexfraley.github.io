# **Standardized sUAS Testing for Public Safety**
🚀 **A Collaborative Initiative by NIST, DOJ, and DHS**  

In **August 2020**, I contributed to the **modeling, site setup planning, fabrication, and execution of standardized test evaluations** for **small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS)** as part of the **National Unmanned Aircraft Systems Program**. This initiative, led by the **Department of Justice (DOJ)** and **Department of Homeland Security (DHS)** in collaboration with **NIST**, aimed to develop standardized performance assessments for UAVs used in **public safety, emergency response, and law enforcement applications**.

As part of the **NIST Emergency Response Robots Project**, I helped design **test lane layouts, fabricate test structures, and execute trials** that measured UAV capabilities in **flight, perception, and data collection in real-world conditions**.

## **📡 What Was Evaluated?**
### **Three Key Mission Categories for sUAS**
1️⃣ **Medium-Range Reconnaissance** – Exterior structure surveillance & mapping  
2️⃣ **Indoor Reconnaissance** – GPS-denied environments & confined spaces  
3️⃣ **Scene Investigation & Mapping** – High-resolution imaging for site documentation  

Each system underwent a **comprehensive evaluation** using **standardized UAV performance metrics**, assessing **flight endurance, maneuverability, data transmission, and sensor effectiveness**.

## **🔬 Standardized Testing Methods**
🛠 **20+ Evaluations Based on NIST sUAS Test Methods**  

I helped set up and execute standardized test procedures, ensuring UAVs met **ASTM International (E54.09) and NFPA 2400 standards** for public safety operations.  

✔ **Battery endurance testing** – Evaluating UAV operational duration under real-world conditions  
✔ **Aerial mapping & imaging accuracy** – Assessing high-resolution imaging for scene documentation  
✔ **Obstacle avoidance & navigation** – Testing flight stability in complex environments  
✔ **Data encryption & communication range** – Measuring secure and reliable UAV telemetry  
✔ **Stability in wind conditions** – Evaluating UAV performance in variable weather  

My role included **optimizing the test lanes, calibrating test apparatus, and ensuring reproducible measurements** for **quantitative performance evaluations**.

## **📍 Event Details**
📍 **Location:** Montgomery County Police Training Facility, MD  
🗓 **Date:** August 3-7, 2020  

This **federally-supported test site** became a **regional training & evaluation center for UAVs** used in **public safety and emergency response scenarios**.  

I helped **design the site layout, fabricate evaluation stations, and coordinate test execution** to **simulate real-world UAV deployment conditions**.

## **🦺 Ensuring Safety & Reliability**
To maintain **safe and effective UAV operations**, testing included:  
✅ **Operator proficiency assessments** – Measuring remote pilot skill using NIST-standardized trials  
✅ **Flight performance in realistic conditions** – Assessing UAV handling in confined, open, and obstructed areas  
✅ **System reliability evaluations** – Testing UAV functionality under stress conditions such as **low-light navigation, sensor accuracy, and obstacle detection**

## **📢 Outcomes & Next Steps**
The results from this testing helped shape **national UAV performance standards**, guiding procurement decisions for **DOJ and DHS agencies**. The facility continues to serve as a **training ground for UAV credentialing and pilot evaluation**.

As a researcher and engineer at NIST, I contributed to the **design and execution of these UAV test trials**, ensuring **repeatable, objective metrics** were established for **federal UAV deployments**.
